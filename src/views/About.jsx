                    Hello! My name is Caleb and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet and helps out people. My interest in programming grew back in 2017 when I decided to write a blog, lack of good themes on the platform and thinking lot of people will read my blog I decided to make my own templates â€” turns out customizing blogger templates and creating new from scratch taught me a lot about the whole front end world.
